LONG RANGE ANTENNA

This antenna will extend the range of your Wi-Fi or 2.4GHz devices (like 
surveillance cameras) into many miles and kilometers. A Yagi antenna is basically 
a telescope for radio waves. The Yagi antenna has 20 parasitic elements. This 
ensures it has a long-range communication , although having a long-range 
communication does sacrifice on beam width. We have used a 20mm stainless steel boom, 3mm stainless steel parasitic elements, 
6mm stainless steel reflector element and a 3mm copper tube for the dipole. We 
calculated the values to get all the position for all the elements of the antenna.
